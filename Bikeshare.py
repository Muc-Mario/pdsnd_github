# OVERVIEW:
# In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
# You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
# You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
